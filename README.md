# Optimization of a Bridge Analysis System
This application is in Python and uses a MapReduce architecture.

## Description
Hadoop is a popular open-source framework for processing Big Data that includes a processing component that implements the MapReduce mode. However, MapReduce paradigm is not a solution for every data-processing problem. 

This study took a bridge investment analysis system as a case study to see if MapReduce improves the system's performance. The system lets the users load, screen, and analyze over 700,000 records of federal bridges. The system load process is quite complex and slow. It performs all sorts of ETL operations on bridge records. 

This study proposes a MapReduce solution for the system load process and discusses the implementation details, and evaluates the performance of the solution.
